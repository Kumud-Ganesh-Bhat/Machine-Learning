Implementing regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). 
During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. 
Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two diï¬€erent tests. 
From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. 
To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

Files Used in the exercise

3. sigmoid.m % code that computes sigmoid function i.e., hypothesis for logistic regression
4. plotData.m % plotting the training dataset
5. plotDecisionBoundary.m %plotting decision boundary
6. mapFeature.m %Generating polynomial features
7. costFunctionReg.m %Cost function for regularized logistic regression
8. predict.m % predicting labels based on hypothesis output (threshold >= 0.5)
