Problem Description: Build a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university
"Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams"
We have historical data from previous applicants that can be used as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, we have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. 
Task is to build a classiﬁcation model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.
